# Attendance Monitoring System Using Face Recognition

This project implements a real-time face recognition-based attendance system using Python. It utilizes `OpenCV` and the `face_recognition` library to detect and recognize faces from a webcam feed, then logs attendance in a CSV file with timestamps.

## üìå Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Attendance logging with name and time
- Daily CSV file generation for attendance records
- User interface showing video feed with names
- Efficient frame processing for performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `face_recognition`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `csv`, `datetime`

## üì¶ Requirements

Install required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
